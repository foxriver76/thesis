# Learning with coresets in non-stationary environments
This chapter is grouped in 3 subfolders:

- classifier - MEB-based classifier (file: __mainTest.py__)
- detector - (K-)MEBWIND CD detection experiments (file: __conf_matrix.py__)
- multiclass - Multiclass Core Vector Machine (file: __mainTest.py__)

The most important files are written in brackets. For the classification algorithms,
this is mainTest.py which will execute the runtime and accuracy tests.
For the Concept Drift detectors, the main file is __conf_matrix.py__ which will create 
the confusion matrix and the F1 score.
